# Puffwise

Puffwise is a habit-tracking app that helps users cut down on smoking or vaping through puff counting, insights, and progress tracking.

## Overview

Puffwise is designed to provide a better user experience than existing habit-tracking alternatives in this space. Rather than focusing on monetization through ads, Puffwise prioritizes a clean, ad-free interface with thoughtful features that genuinely help users track and reduce their nicotine consumption.

## MVP Features

- **Puff Counter**: Simple, quick logging of individual puffs ✅
  - Interactive button to log each puff
  - Real-time count display with timestamp tracking
  - Clean, accessible UI with large tap targets
- **Daily Summary**: View total puff count for the current day ✅
  - Each puff logged with timestamp
  - Persistent storage using UserDefaults with JSON encoding
  - Smart date filtering to show only today's puffs
  - Data survives app restarts
- **Basic History**: See puff counts for previous days (In Progress)
- **Clean UI**: Minimal, distraction-free interface without ads ✅

## Technical Stack

- **Platform**: iOS
- **Language**: Swift with SwiftUI
- **Min iOS Version**: 17.0
- **Architecture**: SwiftUI App lifecycle
